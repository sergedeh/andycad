<p>
Use this command to display the active document as it would appear when printed.  When you choose this command, the main window will be replaced with a print preview window in which one or two pages will be displayed in their printed format.  The <a href="afxp3i9e.htm">print preview toolbar</a> offers you options to view either one or two pages at a time; move back and forth through the document; zoom in and out of pages; and initiate a print job.</p>
